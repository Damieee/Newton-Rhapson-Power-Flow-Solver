# The fast decoupled method is a widely used algorithm for power flow analysis in electrical power systems. It is an approximation technique that simplifies the complex calculations involved in power flow analysis, making it computationally efficient while maintaining reasonable accuracy.

# Here's a basic Python implementation of the fast decoupled method for power flow analysis:

import numpy as np

def fast_decoupled_power_flow(Ybus, Sbus, V0, max_iter=20, tol=1e-6):
    # Initialize variables
    num_buses = Ybus.shape[0]
    V = V0.copy()
    P = np.real(Sbus)
    Q = np.imag(Sbus)
    Pcalc = np.zeros(num_buses)
    Qcalc = np.zeros(num_buses)

    # Perform fast decoupled power flow iterations
    for iteration in range(max_iter):
        # Update Pcalc and Qcalc based on current voltage estimates
        for i in range(num_buses):
            for j in range(num_buses):
                Pcalc[i] += V[i] * (V[i] * Ybus[i, j].real - V[j] * Ybus[i, j].imag)
                Qcalc[i] += V[i] * (V[i] * Ybus[i, j].imag + V[j] * Ybus[i, j].real)

        # Update voltage magnitudes
        for i in range(num_buses):
            V[i] = np.sqrt((P[i] - Pcalc[i]) ** 2 + (Q[i] - Qcalc[i]) ** 2) / np.abs(V[i])

        # Check convergence
        if np.max(np.abs(P - Pcalc)) < tol and np.max(np.abs(Q - Qcalc)) < tol:
            break

    return V

# Example usage
Ybus = np.array([[0.04-0.1j, -0.04+0.02j, 0.0+0.08j],
                 [-0.04+0.02j, 0.06-0.1j, 0.0+0.04j],
                 [0.0+0.08j, 0.0+0.04j, 0.03-0.12j]])
Sbus = np.array([100 + 50j, 80 + 30j, 0 + 0j])
V0 = np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])
V = fast_decoupled_power_flow(Ybus, Sbus, V0)
print("Voltage Magnitudes:")
print(V)

# In this implementation, the fast_decoupled_power_flow function takes the admittance matrix Ybus, complex power injections Sbus, and initial voltage estimates V0 as inputs. It iteratively updates the voltage magnitudes using the fast decoupled method until convergence is achieved. The maximum number of iterations and the tolerance for convergence can be specified as optional arguments.

# The example usage demonstrates how to call the fast_decoupled_power_flow function with a sample admittance matrix Ybus, complex power injections Sbus, and initial voltage estimates V0. The resulting voltage magnitudes are then printed.

# Please note that this is a basic implementation, and it may not handle certain cases or system configurations. It's always recommended to use validated and tested power flow libraries or consult domain experts for critical power flow analysis tasks
